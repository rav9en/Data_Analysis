# 📊 Credit Risk Analysis of Bank Customers
An R-based analytics project that explores credit behavior and demographic factors influencing risk segmentation in the banking sector.

## 📁 Overview
This project investigates the application of data analytics techniques to assess credit risk using a real-world dataset that includes detailed demographic and behavioral attributes of bank customers. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploration, transformation, visualization, and modeling, with a focus on identifying key patterns and factors that distinguish high-risk and low-risk customers.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess the raw dataset for accurate analysis
- Explore patterns across customer demographics and credit behavior
- Apply classification and visualization techniques to understand credit risk
- Identify attributes that correlate strongly with credit defaults
- Provide actionable insights and recommendations for stakeholders

## 🧪 Dataset Description
The dataset contains records of customer attributes, including:
- Demographics: Gender, marital status, employment status
- Credit behavior: Duration of installment, loan purpose, loan amount, repayment history
- Target variable: Credit risk status (e.g., good vs. bad credit)

## 🔧 Techniques & Tools Used
### 🗃️ Preprocessing
- Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data entries
- Data type conversions and normalization of categorical fields
- Encoding techniques: one-hot encoding, factor conversion
### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Distribution analysis using ggplot2 and plotly
- Cross-tabulations for categorical correlation insights
- Outlier detection using boxplots and z-scores
### 🧰 Data Manipulation
- Grouping and aggregation (dplyr, tidyverse)
- Feature engineering: derivation of new variables (e.g., loan-to-income ratio)
### 🔍 Visualization
- Correlation heatmaps to show feature interrelationships
- Bar plots and histograms by demographic segments
- Risk segmentation maps using clustering or decision tree visualization
### 🧠 Advanced Analysis
- Logistic regression or decision trees for credit classification
- Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall
- Feature importance analysis for variable justificatio
### 📈 Sample Graphs & Outputs
Visualizations included in the report:
- Age distribution vs. loan purpose
- Default rates by employment type
- Credit duration vs. risk status
- Heatmap showing feature correlation
